# MLP_Model_for_MNIST

This project is designed to show how different optimization algorithms work for multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. The project builds an AI model using popular tools like Python and TensorFlow. This model takes the dataset and trains it with the optimization algorithm of your choice. Once the training is done, you can see the results and metrics in graphs. The project can be useful for people working or learning in the fields of data mining, artificial intelligence and deep learning.

Easy to Use

Here's what you need to do to use the project:

Download this repository to your computer or a cloud server.
Install the required libraries and download the dataset.
Run the main training file or the Jupyter Notebook file. You can train your model with the optimization algorithm of your choice.
When training is complete, use the project's graphing and analyzing tools to evaluate results and benchmarks.
If you want, you can add your own dataset or model to the project.
Contribute and Support

You can contribute to make this project better and test more optimization algorithms. Any contribution, feedback or questions are welcome to the project.
